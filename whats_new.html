                At the end of February I will be travelling to Indiana to visit Jonathan MacArt at Notre Dame and give a talk to the FlowPAC fluid dynamics seminar.
            </li>
            <li>
                I will also be giving a <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=80926">talk</a> at the SIAM CSE conference in Fort Worth, Texas.

                The first paper to come from my work on DSMC is out on Arxiv!

                The Junior Applied Maths Seminar is back this term - Week 8 will see my colleague and office mate Adam Jones talking about robust deep hedging.

                In July I was in G&#246ttingen at the 33rd Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics, giving a talk on machine learning for DSMC simulations. Definitely a highlight of the year so far!
            </li>
            <li>
                I attended the Applied Mathematics Postgraduate conference at Warwick, which I helped to organise along with the Warwick SIAM student chapter. As well as chairing a session for the first time, I gave a talk about my work on neural network models for DSMC. You can see the slides <a href="docs/AMP24.pdf" attributes-list download="Slides AMP24">here</a>.

                Our paper on inducing sparsity in deep neural networks has been accepted at ICLR 2024. You can also now read it on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16184">arxiv</a>.

                I will be at the 2024 AIAA Scitech Forum in January to present my work on deep learning for the BGK equation.
            </li>
            <li>
                My CDT colleague Samuel Lam is going to present our work on sparsity in deep neural networks at the Conference on Parsimony and Learning in Hong Kong in January.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm helping to organise the Junior Applied Maths Seminar here at Oxford. 
                The next speaker is my CDT colleague <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/julius.villar">Julius Villar</a> who will be talking about his work on percolations at 12.30 17/10 in C4.
