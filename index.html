            <p>I'm a DPhil student at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, working with <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/justin.sirignano">Justin Sirignano</a>,
            and funded by the EPSRC CDT for the Mathematics of Random Systems.</p>
            <p>
                I work on applying machine learning and adjoint optimisation to models of rarefied gas dynamics.
                I currently focus on using machine learning to accelerate and optimise over particle methods such as DSMC and Direct Molecular Simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a background in physics, with a Master's in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from Oxford, and also previously worked as a strat at Goldman Sachs, pricing equity delta one derivatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please feel free to get in touch to talk about mathematics, physics or finance!
