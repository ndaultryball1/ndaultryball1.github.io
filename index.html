            <p>I'm a DPhil student at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, working with <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/justin.sirignano">Justin Sirignano</a>,
            and funded by the EPSRC CDT for the Mathematics of Random Systems.</p>
            <p>
                I work on applying machine learning and adjoint optimisation methods to the numerical solution of kinetic equations.
                I currently focus on using neural networks to learn parameters in BGK type equations, and on optimisation of DSMC algorithms for the Boltzmann equation.
                I have also spent time working on sparsity in deep neural networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a background in physics, with a Master's in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from Oxford, and also previously worked as a strat at Goldman Sachs, pricing equity delta one derivatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please feel free to get in touch to talk about mathematics, physics or finance!
